    <strong>1. Tuition fees and frequency of lessons:</strong>
    <p>Tuition fees are charged on a monthly basis at the beginning of each month. Payment will be auto-deducted from your customer account on a monthly basis through Visa, Mastercard, or American Express credit cards. Under normal circumstances, monthly tuition fees would cover your enrolment packages that you are subscribed for. Lessons in the 5th week (29th, 30th, and 31st) will auto-schedule any outstanding make-up credits in your account (minimum of your enrolment package duration). In the event there are no outstanding make ups or pre-make ups arranged (within 60-days), the 5th lesson will be billed to your account 7-days prior to the 5th lesson day (once billed, any cancellations of this lesson will be considered a make-up). A non- refundable registration fee of $25 is required for all new students, and is inclusive of an Aureus Academy enrolment kit.</p>
    
    <h4 class="f-title"><strong>2. Security Deposit:</strong></h4>
    <p>Aureus Academy requires one-month (4 lessons) advanced notice for termination of lessons. This security deposit will be refunded to you with one-month (4 lessons) notice or will serve in-lieu of any remaining unpaid lessons within the one-month (4 lesson) notice. Should lessons be terminated without a 30 day advanced notice, the security deposit will be forfeited. Informing an instructor of intent to withdraw, or not attending classes, does not constitute withdrawal from lessons.</p>
    
    <h4 class="f-title"><strong>3. Missed Lessons:y</strong></h4>
    <p>For individual lessons there will be no make up for any cancellation of lessons by the student unless given a minimum of 24 hours notice. In the event a student cancels a lesson on less than 24-hour notice, supporting documents, such as a Medical Certificate, must be provided to receive the make-up credit. Group lessons require 24 hour notice in order to be considered for a make up lesson. For Group Lessons, make up lessons have to be for the same group lesson type or it will be forfeited. Should the teacher need to cancel a lesson, regardless of the reason, it will be replaced and not prorated. This replacement will be re-scheduled accordingly to accommodate the time schedule of both parties.</p>
    
    <h4 class="f-title"><strong>4. Student Absence Policy:</strong></h4>
    <p>Tuition fees will be due as per normal, regardless of scheduling changes.

    <p>There will be lessons conducted on the following public holidays (Good Friday, Vesak Day, Hari Raya Puasa, Hari Raya Haji, and Deepavali). If the lesson falls on a public holiday that we are closed, the lesson will be cancelled and added to your account as a make-up credit. Should the teacher take annual leave, lessons will be made up either before or after the leave period using the standard make-up lesson policy.</p>
    
    <h4 class="f-title"><strong>6. Make-Up-Lessons:</strong></h4>
    <p>In the event lessons are cancelled in advanced, lessons can be made up on another day and time with the teacher. Make-up lessons need to be completed within 120 days of the cancelled lesson or they are forfeited. In the unlikely event the instructor is full and cannot make up the lessons, the customer has the option to make up the lessons with another teacher.</p>
    <p>Should the customer submit withdrawal notice from the school, outstanding make up lessons need to be completed before the 30-day notice period has ended; otherwise, they are forfeited. Make-up lessons do not replace paid lessons and cannot be extended past the withdrawal notice of 30-days.</p>
