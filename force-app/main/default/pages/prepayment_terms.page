                                The Pre-Payment is a special promotion in conjunction with GSS 2019 and it is not compulsory, 
                                so customers can decide to participate in this promotion or not.

								<p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 3px;margin-left: 18px;">
                            		Similar to regular lessons, as long as you continue after the pre-payment period is
									complete, any pending make up lessons will still be valid for 4 months, as per student
									policy. If any termination of enrolment has been made, any make up lessons will need to
									be completed before the end of your last lesson.

							<p style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 3px;margin-left: 18px;">
                            	As this is a promotional package, unfortunately we will not be allowing any downgrading
                                (i.e. from 45 to 30-min lesson packages) of classes. However, for lesson advancements,
                                customers will simply have to pay the deposit top up + difference in lesson fees for the
                                remaining months. The formula will be 60 / 45 mins lesson fee - our fixed prices
                                corresponding with the previous package (i.e. 45 mins is either $349 or $320, 30 mins is
                                either $235 or $213). We will not be calculating the top up from the discounted fees that
                                the customer has already paid (so they continue to enjoy a discount).

								unused lessons under any circumstances.

                            		Aureus does not change teachers very often as we have a minimal turnover of our staff.
                                    If we change the teacher as a staff member leaves, we will have a transition where the
                                    new teacher will sit in the lessons with the existing teacher before taking over.

                            	Customers from centres with a lower fee structure who wish to switch to a centre with
								higher fee structure will have to top up the difference in fees. We will be calculating the
								top up fees from the fixed Aureus price corresponding with their package and not from
                                the discounted fees that they had prepaid. We will not be able to refund the difference
                                for customers moving from a higher fee centre to a lower fee centre.
